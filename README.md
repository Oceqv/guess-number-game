# Number Guessing Game (While Loop Practice)

This is a small Python project I made while **studying `while` loops** and basic control flow.
I’m currently learning Python as part of my **malware analyst / cybersecurity learning path**, and this game was built to practice looping logic, conditions, and user input.

## What This Project Does

* Gives the user **3 attempts** to guess a secret number
* Uses a `while` loop to control how many guesses are allowed
* Ends early if the correct number is guessed
* Prints a message when the user runs out of attempts

## Why I Made This

I built this project to:

* Practice **`while` loops**
* Learn how to control program flow using counters
* Get comfortable with **input, conditionals, and breaking loops**
* Strengthen Python fundamentals before moving on to more advanced security topics

## How It Works

* The game starts with 3 attempts
* Each loop represents one guess
* If the guess is wrong, attempts decrease
* If the guess is correct, the loop stops

## Example Output

```
Guess The Number: 50
Nope you have 2 Attempts left!
Guess The Number: 70
Nope you have 1 Attempts left!
Guess The Number: 67
Good job you guessed it right!
```

## Notes

* The secret number is currently set to `67`
* This is a beginner practice project
* More projects will be added as I continue learning Python and cybersecurity concept.
